6) Loops::

    Loops are use to repeating some task.

    a) For loop-

        for(initialization; condition; updation){
            //do something
        }

        #initialisation]- makes a varible which contains some value from which loop starts.
        #condition]- its a statement or condition or terminating condition which define how 
                     far the loop will run.

        * [if there is no terminating condition this makes infinite loop]      

        #updation]- update the value of some varible .


    b) While loop-

        while(condition){
            //do something
        }

        same as for loop but here we consider loop w.r.t the condition(only)
        here we initialize the value before the loop and update condition 
        inside the loop scope.

    c) Do while loop-

        do{
            //do something
        }while(condition);

        here we perform our task in the do scope and the condition will take
        place in while loop. 

        *[in that case if the condition never satisfy thus the code will run for one time fo the do scope].
